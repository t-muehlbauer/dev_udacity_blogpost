## Project Motivation
This is a Udacity Nanodegree project on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on German society between 2019 and 2021. Two analog social surveys were conducted by GESIS in 2018 and 2021. My personal interest in the social developments during the pandemic has led me to ask the following questions:

How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact German society in terms of:
1. Perception of luck (J001, I028)
2. Trust in the government (pt03, pt12, ps01)
3. Behavior in the election (pa04, pt15, pv01, pv04)

The responses of the population are classified into social classes based on how the participants perceive themselves. (F035 - id02)

## Installation and Libraries
The code is compatible with Python version 3.* and relies on the following libraries:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
5. Collections
6. Math
To install these libraries, please run "pip install -r requirements.txt" command on the command line.

## Dataset Description
This project is based on the ALLBUS dataset - the German General Social Survey.
"[...] Established in 1980, its mission is to monitor attitudes, behavior, and social change in Germany. Each ALLBUS cross-sectional survey consists of one or two main question modules covering changing topics, a range of supplementary questions and a core module providing detailed demographic information. Additionally, data on the interview and the interviewers are provided as well. Key topics generally follow a 10-year replication cycle, many individual indicators and item batteries are replicated at shorter intervals. [...]"
